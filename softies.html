    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> SOFT CORAL CARE</h2>
    <p>Soft corals are flexible, often tree- or mushroom-shaped corals that don’t produce a hard skeleton. They're known for their motion, hardiness, and tolerance of varying water conditions, making them a favorite among beginners and experienced aquarists alike.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> LOCATION</h2>
    <p>Soft corals are native to tropical reef environments in the Indo-Pacific, Red Sea, and Caribbean. They can be found in both shallow and deeper reef zones where current is present but not intense.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> LIGHTING</h2>
    <p>These corals thrive under moderate lighting conditions. Intense lighting is generally not required, though coloration may vary depending on the type of light and depth placement.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low Light</strong>: 30–75 PAR</li>
      <li><strong>Medium Light</strong>: 75–120 PAR</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> WATER FLOW</h2>
    <p>Moderate, indirect flow is ideal. Water movement keeps detritus from settling on polyps and allows for their signature swaying motion. Avoid blasting them directly with strong flow.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> FEEDING</h2>
    <p>Most soft corals rely heavily on photosynthesis but benefit from dissolved organics and fine particulate foods. Some aquarists dose aminos or phytoplankton to enhance color and growth.</p>

  <section class="info">
    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> PROPAGATION</h2>
    <p>Softies are easy to frag. You can cut branches or pieces and attach them to new rock using rubber bands, toothpicks, or coral glue. They heal quickly and adapt to new placements.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> A WORD OF CAUTION</h2>
    <p>Some softies like leathers and toadstools can release allelopathic chemicals that inhibit the growth of neighboring corals. Carbon filtration and water changes help reduce this risk.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> ACCLIMATION</h2>
    <p>Soft corals acclimate quickly and tolerate a range of conditions. Still, it's best to perform drip acclimation and give them time to adjust to new light and water parameters.</p>
