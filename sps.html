    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> ACROPORA CARE</h2>
    <p>Acropora are the crown jewel of the SPS world. No other genus has the sheer number of species or variety. Acropora are one of the most difficult corals to keep. They are highly sensitive to changes in water chemistry and require the most in terms of flow and light.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> LOCATION</h2>
    <p>Indo-Pacific - Acropora are found in the islands of the Indo-Pacific including Fiji, Tonga, Solomon Islands, and the Great Barrier Reef.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> LIGHTING</h2>
    <p>High lighting would serve this species well. Acropora can be kept under high output fluorescent bulbs (T5), but may benefit from more intense lighting such as metal halide (MH). It will likely change its coloration depending on the lighting provided.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low Light</strong>: 30-50 PAR</li>
      <li><strong>Medium Light</strong>: 50-150 PAR</li>
      <li><strong>High Light</strong>: Over 150 PAR</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> WATER FLOW</h2>
    <p>Strong variable water movement is recommended. Acropora are one of the most flow-loving corals. Audit the flow of your tank regularly as Acropora colonies grow and shape water patterns.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> FEEDING</h2>
    <p>Acropora benefit from direct feeding. Use meaty rotifer-based foods and HUFA-enriched options. Defrost frozen foods and apply them with a turkey baster to target colonies.</p>

  <section class="info">
    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> PROPAGATION</h2>
    <p>This genus is widely propagated and suitable for aquaculture. A sustainable harvest can be achieved with proper care and tank conditions.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> A WORD OF CAUTION</h2>
    <p>Despite being common and adaptive, Acropora are not beginner corals. They are highly sensitive to rapid tissue necrosis (RTN), infections, and unstable water parameters.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> ACCLIMATION</h2>
    <p>Acropora require careful acclimation due to stress from shipping. Always allow a slow transition to your tank conditions to avoid shock.</p>
