    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> LPS CORAL CARE</h2>
    <p>LPS, or Large Polyp Stony corals, are a favorite among reef hobbyists for their vibrant colors, flowing tentacles, and moderate care level. They offer a perfect balance of beauty and resilience, making them great for intermediate reef keepers.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> LOCATION</h2>
    <p>LPS corals are found in tropical reef environments, primarily throughout the Indo-Pacific region. Some common regions include Fiji, Tonga, Indonesia, and the Great Barrier Reef. They typically inhabit mid to lower reef zones where water flow and light levels are moderate.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> LIGHTING</h2>
    <p>LPS corals prefer moderate lighting conditions. Intense lighting may cause bleaching or tissue damage, while low light can limit their growth and coloration. Position them mid to low in your aquarium and gradually acclimate them to new lighting setups.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low Light</strong>: 30-70 PAR</li>
      <li><strong>Medium Light</strong>: 70-150 PAR</li>
      <li><strong>High Light</strong>: Not recommended for most LPS species</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> WATER FLOW</h2>
    <p>LPS corals thrive in low to moderate water flow. Too much flow can damage their fleshy polyps, while too little can result in detritus buildup. A gentle, indirect flow that sways their tentacles is ideal for health and feeding.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> FEEDING</h2>
    <p>LPS corals are photosynthetic but benefit significantly from supplemental feeding. Use coral foods such as mysis shrimp, brine shrimp, and coral-specific blends. Target feeding helps promote faster growth and fuller polyp extension.</p>

  <section class="info">
    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> PROPAGATION</h2>
    <p>LPS corals can be propagated through careful fragging, usually by cutting between polyp heads with a bandsaw or coral cutter. Many species like Acanthastrea and Euphyllia regenerate well if handled correctly and placed in stable tank conditions.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> A WORD OF CAUTION</h2>
    <p>Be cautious of sweeper tentacles. Many LPS corals, such as Hammer, Torch, and Frogspawn, extend long tentacles at night that can sting nearby corals. Leave adequate spacing to avoid aggression in your tank.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> ACCLIMATION</h2>
    <p>LPS corals need slow acclimation to lighting and water chemistry. Sudden changes can lead to tissue recession or bleaching. Drip acclimation and gradual light acclimation help ensure successful transitions to your reef system.</p>
