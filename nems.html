    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> ANEMONE CARE</h2>
    <p>Anemones are captivating and often the centerpiece of reef aquariums. Known for their swaying tentacles and symbiotic relationship with clownfish, anemones require stable tank conditions and a bit more experience, making them suitable for intermediate to advanced hobbyists.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> LOCATION</h2>
    <p>Anemones are found throughout tropical oceans, especially in the Indo-Pacific region. They attach themselves to rock or substrate and can move if unhappy with conditions.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> LIGHTING</h2>
    <p>Anemones are photosynthetic and require moderate to high lighting. LEDs, T5s, or metal halides are commonly used. Proper lighting helps maintain color and support health.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low Light</strong>: Not Recommended</li>
      <li><strong>Medium Light</strong>: 100–150 PAR</li>
      <li><strong>High Light</strong>: 150–250 PAR</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> WATER FLOW</h2>
    <p>Moderate to strong flow is ideal. Anemones should receive varied flow without being blasted directly. Too much direct flow may cause them to detach and wander.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> FEEDING</h2>
    <p>Anemones benefit from regular feedings of meaty foods like mysis shrimp, silversides, or chopped seafood. Feeding once or twice per week encourages growth and helps maintain color.</p>

  <section class="info">
    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> PROPAGATION</h2>
    <p>Some anemones, such as Bubble Tips, can split naturally or be manually propagated by experienced reefers. Always use caution as improper handling can harm the animal.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> A WORD OF CAUTION</h2>
    <p>Anemones can sting nearby corals and move unpredictably. Ensure they have adequate space. Their foot must be protected during acclimation and positioning. Avoid powerheads without protective covers.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> ACCLIMATION</h2>
    <p>Use drip acclimation over 30–45 minutes to adjust to tank parameters. Anemones are sensitive to salinity, pH, and temperature swings, so stability is key.</p>
