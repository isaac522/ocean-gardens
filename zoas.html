    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> ZOANTHID CARE</h2>
    <p>Zoanthids, often referred to as "Zoas," are colorful, button-like polyps that are highly popular for reef aquariums. Known for their vibrant patterns and ease of care, Zoas come in hundreds of named varieties. These corals are a great choice for both beginners and advanced reefers.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> LOCATION</h2>
    <p>Zoanthids are found in warm, shallow reef areas throughout the Indo-Pacific, especially in Fiji, Tonga, and Indonesia. They often grow in colonies across rocks and reef flats.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> LIGHTING</h2>
    <p>Zoas thrive in a wide range of lighting. Moderate light helps maintain vibrant coloration, though some varieties can tolerate higher or lower intensities.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low Light</strong>: 30–50 PAR</li>
      <li><strong>Medium Light</strong>: 50–150 PAR</li>
      <li><strong>High Light</strong>: Over 150 PAR (use with caution to avoid bleaching)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> WATER FLOW</h2>
    <p>Moderate to high, indirect flow is ideal. This helps keep debris off the polyps and promotes healthy growth and polyp extension. Avoid direct strong flow as it may prevent the polyps from opening.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> FEEDING</h2>
    <p>While Zoas primarily rely on photosynthesis, they benefit from occasional feeding of small particle foods like reef roids, phyto, or powdered coral blends. Target feeding can encourage faster growth and coloration.</p>

  <section class="info">
    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> PROPAGATION</h2>
    <p>Zoanthids are one of the easiest corals to frag. They naturally grow in mats and can be cut and glued to frag plugs or rock rubble. Many reefers trade and collect named varieties.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> A WORD OF CAUTION</h2>
    <p>Some Zoas contain palytoxin, a very dangerous compound if mishandled. Always wear gloves and eye protection when fragging, and ensure adequate ventilation.</p>

    <h2><img src="section-icon.jpg" class="icon"> ACCLIMATION</h2>
    <p>Slow drip acclimation is recommended. Zoas can be sensitive to salinity swings and lighting changes. Start them low in the tank and gradually move them up if desired.</p>
